			<!-- Animal Description-->
			<p class="two">Grizzly bears once roamed throughout the entire western United States south into Mexico, including the Great Plains and along rivers in desert habitats.
				Grizzly bears are omnivores. The most commonly eaten kinds of plants are fleshy roots, fruits, berries, grasses, and forbs.
				If grizzly bears are on the hunt, their prey can include fish (especially salmon), rodents like ground squirrels, and hoofed animals like moose, elk, caribou, and deer.</p>
